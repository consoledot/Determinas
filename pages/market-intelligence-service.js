            <p>
              As a firm trying to expand its market, Our opportunity assessment
              services can assist by integrating market research and client data
              to identify growth potential in a specific industry or company
              sector and devising a strategy to capitalise on these
              opportunities.

            <h3>Benchmarking Studies</h3>
            <p>
              Benchmarking is used to determine what is working, what is not
              working, and what your competitors are doing to maximise income
              and brand exposure. Determinas use this procedure to achieve your
              business objectives, giving out a clear and actionable strategy
              for checking which competitors to benchmark.

          <h3>Consumers Insights</h3>
          <p>
            Determinas uses Consumer insights to understand and interpret
            customer data, behaviours, and feedback to make conclusions that
            clients can use to improve product development and customer support.
            It also enables clients to learn more about why customers behave in
            specific ways based on variables and factors such as brand
            perception and relevant marketing messages. Using Machine learning
            and A.I, these can be achieved by:
